Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which does not
depend on the X Window System. It is designed to locate fonts within the system
and select them according to requirements specified by applications.

This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache (fc-cache), a
sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), and a program to test the
matching rules (fc-match). It also makes fonts managed by defoma available to
fontconfig applications.
