cat << EOF
Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to that of
OpenGL.

To the extent that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL command syntax or state machine, it
is being used with authorization from Silicon Graphics, Inc.(SGI).

mesa-lib provides libGL.so, needed for many different programs.
