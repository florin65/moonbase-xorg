xf86-video-vesa provides the X.Org generic VESA video driver. This driver uses
the standard VESA interface provided on all video cards. Note that this driver
runs completely unaccelerated and is not recommended for normal daily use,
however it is good to have available in case your video card's normal driver
is experiencing problems.
